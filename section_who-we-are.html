<p>So at UPcload on average we have like 20k rpm (requests per minute) and
on peak it goes up to 50rpm, average response time was an amazing
30-50ms after we did a lot of optimising.  The garment data is quite
complex so we used Redis to cache objects, one product had a garment and
a mannequin so a request would query 10 tables.  There&#39;s a MySQL cluster
we set up, with mostly read-only slaves because the entire app was very
read-heavy with few writes.
The sever farm is a bunch of nodejs-clusters, performing very well (low
CPU &lt; 10% even on load) on Heroku and on DigitalOcean.</p>

<a href="http://webcam.upcload.com/upcload">http://webcam.upcload.com/upcload</a> used all over the world (e.g. in South

that act as a worker queue to do the number crunching: up to 100% cpu
load each time body dimensions are calculated from webcam images.</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s m-click.aero, a set of high-reliability and bug-free
management tools for flight controllers.  It&#39;s about managing air
spaces, booking missions and checking with business rules, e.g. whether
certain flight routes are legal.  The DB is Postgres, Back-end ist
partly Java (for rules processing, XML) and PHP (for making DB requests)
using Zend and Laravel.  Front-end is JavaScript (ExtJS) with complex
data-centric user interfaces.  The software must not have any bugs once
it&#39;s in production and the servers must never be down.  Currently I&#39;m
working on a connection between Flight Control Stations and the air
space management software.  The part that speaks the proprietary Flight
Control communication protocol is written in Java, the Rest is Postgres
and Zend.</p>

<a href="http://webcam.upcload.com/upcload">http://webcam.upcload.com/upcload</a> used all over the world (e.g. in South
Africa and Japan).  There&#39;s bunch of image processing servers deployed
that act as a worker queue to do the number crunching: up to 100% cpu
load each time body dimensions are calculated from webcam images.</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s m-click.aero, a set of high-reliability and bug-free
management tools for flight controllers.  It&#39;s about managing air
spaces, booking missions and checking with business rules, e.g. whether
certain flight routes are legal.  The DB is Postgres, Back-end ist
partly Java (for rules processing, XML) and PHP (for making DB requests)
using Zend and Laravel.  Front-end is JavaScript (ExtJS) with complex
data-centric user interfaces.  The software must not have any bugs once
it&#39;s in production and the servers must never be down.  Currently I&#39;m
working on a connection between Flight Control Stations and the air
space management software.  The part that speaks the proprietary Flight
Control communication protocol is written in Java, the Rest is Postgres
and Zend.</p>

we set up, with mostly read-only slaves because the entire app was very
read-heavy with few writes.
The sever farm is a bunch of nodejs-clusters, performing very well (low
CPU &lt; 10% even on load) on Heroku and on DigitalOcean.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s UPcload in Action:

<p>It&#39;s also being tested in Russia (otto.ru) and in Brazil
(<a href="http://www.dafiti.com.br/">http://www.dafiti.com.br/</a>) and will be live there soon.</p>
<p>The webcam part of UPcload is used by e-tailors:
<a href="http://webcam.upcload.com/upcload">http://webcam.upcload.com/upcload</a> used all over the world (e.g. in South
Africa and Japan).  There&#39;s bunch of image processing servers deployed
that act as a worker queue to do the number crunching: up to 100% cpu
load each time body dimensions are calculated from webcam images.</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s m-click.aero, a set of high-reliability and bug-free
management tools for flight controllers.  It&#39;s about managing air
spaces, booking missions and checking with business rules, e.g. whether
certain flight routes are legal.  The DB is Postgres, Back-end ist
partly Java (for rules processing, XML) and PHP (for making DB requests)
using Zend and Laravel.  Front-end is JavaScript (ExtJS) with complex
data-centric user interfaces.  The software must not have any bugs once
it&#39;s in production and the servers must never be down.  Currently I&#39;m
working on a connection between Flight Control Stations and the air
space management software.  The part that speaks the proprietary Flight
Control communication protocol is written in Java, the Rest is Postgres
and Zend.</p>
